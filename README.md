# Refacoring an index.html file to follow the accessibility standards

## About this project
This project was done as the first assignment of a codind bootcamp as part of the process to learn about HTML / CSS. I was given a functionaning HTML file and CSS file and tasked to refactor the page to meet the accessbility standards. 

As the following criteria are given to the project:
- Using Semantic HTML elements
- The heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- The icon and image elements have alt attributes
- The title element contains a concise, descriptive title

## How I addressed this challenge

I researched about what the semantic HTML elements are and referred to the following websites;
- [W3 School: HTML semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- [Semrush Blog: Semantic HTML: What It Is and How to Use It Correctly](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/)
- [Smashing magazine: Semantic CSS With Intelligent Selectors](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/semantic-css-with-intelligent-selectors/)

I found the original HTML files are mainly using \<div> elements, so I updated those elements to the following elements to make it semantic HTML.
- \<header>
- \<nav>
- \<section>
- \<article>
- \<aside>
- \<footer>

By grouping each \<div> elements in to semantic elements, I could also upate the heading attributes fall in sequential order within each element. I also updated the CSS to match the updated element names.

After moving the \<ul> element in the \<header> element inside of \<nav> element, display: inline-block started to conclict with float: right in CSS and the list items aligned to the right didn't render as it should be. I did some researches and used [the flexbox property](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to control how the elements in the header are styled to solve this issue.

As a next step, I added the alt text to the icons and images in the file using alt="". There is one background image file referred in the CSS file instead of the index.html, and I used the aria-label element to add the alt text to the background image based on [the blog article about how to add the alt text for background images](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html).

Finally, I added a title representing the content in the page in the \<title> element.
